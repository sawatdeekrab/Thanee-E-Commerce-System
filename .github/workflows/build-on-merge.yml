    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      # We recommend using a specific Node.js version that matches your project's requirements.
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22' # Specify the Node.js version (e.g., '16', '18', '20')

      # Step 3: Cache Node.js modules to speed up subsequent runs
      # This step checks if 'node_modules' exists in the cache based on the package-lock.json hash.
      # If found, it restores them; otherwise, it saves them after installation.
      - name: Cache Node.js modules
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm # Path to cache (npm cache directory)
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }} # Cache key based on OS and package-lock.json
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node- # Fallback key if exact match not found

      # Step 4: Install project dependencies
      # 'npm ci' is preferred over 'npm install' in CI environments as it ensures a clean install
      # based on package-lock.json, leading to more consistent builds.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 5: Build the Angular application
      # 'ng build' compiles the Angular application.
      # '--configuration=production' uses the production build configuration for optimization.
      - name: Build Angular application
        run: npm run build --configuration=production # Or 'ng build --configuration=production' if Angular CLI is globally installed
